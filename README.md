The following program computes the Spider Man numbers of a set of Marvel characters. It uses the “six
degrees of Spider Man” concept to calculate the separation degree of Spider Man for the entire Marvel
Universe. 

This program takes as input an arbitrary number of Marvel characters and for each of these
characters, it prints the characters names as well as their Spider Man number. This is done by comparing
the comics of every character against each other to find the association to a Spider Man comic. 

Additionally, a collaboration matrix between all Marvel characters was constructed. It determines the 
number of instances where each character has been in a comic with another. 

The data used for these values comes from the text file, porgat.txt, which contains every Marvel character and an
association of every comic book they’ve appeared in.
